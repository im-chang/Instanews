Instanews

The objective of this project is to create a responsive website that allows the user to navigate through different news articles by selecting their preferred categories using New York Times API.

Technologies Used:

SASS.
Style.css and Style.min.css
Gulp for running build tasks.
ajax JS to filter and retrieve 12 news articles per category.

Challenges and Future Improvements:

The challenges that I had in creating this project was using the Ajax get method to retrieve the news articles from the New York Times API. Goals for future improvement would be to write a cleaner CSS by eliminating repetitive style codes as well as using variables.
